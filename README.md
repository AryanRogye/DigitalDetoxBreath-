This app is inspired by the book Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport.

## Platforms
This project runs on:

- **watchOS** — this is where the app really lives  
- **iOS** — Apple requires every watchOS app to ship with a companion iOS app  
- **macOS** — I ended up adding a desktop version too, because why not reset your mind while working?

## How This App Connects to Digital Minimalism
The book mentions taking a digital detox. What to do during this detox?

But here’s the reality:
- My Apple Watch isn’t optional.
- For a lot of people, wearables are part of their routine (fitness, notifications, health).
- Completely “disconnecting” isn’t realistic when your life depends on your tech.
---
So instead of fighting the device, this app uses the watch as a tool to support the detox, not break it.

What the app gives you:
- A guided breathing flow (inhale → hold → exhale)
- Haptics synced to each breathing phase
- A minimal UI designed to calm you down, not stimulate you
- A quick way to reset during stressful moments of digital overload

Basically:
If you can’t escape your tech, at least let it help you slow down.
